The toilet paper bundle flies high up in the air.\n\nAt this moment, you realise the frail old lady has suddenly begun sprinting towards you. Her crooked posture and frail bones seem to have been suddenly replaced with Usain Bolt-like muscles. Once in range, the old lady manages to leap incredibly into the air, plucking the toilet paper out of the sky, looking like Michael Jordan in 1996.\n\nBefore you realise, she has landed effortlessly in front of you with all the poise of a gymnastic swan. She quickly flashes you a grin and returns to old lady mode, toddling off towards the cashier. You are left on the floor, sad and beaten.\n\nThe End.",

One-by-one, like crazed zombies, they rush towards you, diving towards your prized possession.\n\n Within seconds you find yourself grappling with an evil horde of shoppers. Their collective body odour has begun to overpower your senses. You collapse to the floor.\n\n...\n\nYou wake up hours later in the same aisle you were in. Except that you have lost your pride, your dignity, and certainly your toilet paper. This was not a good day.\n\nThe End."

In one smooth motion, you quickly pick up the superior cut of wagyu behind Mr. Rude Shopper, and walk off in a huff. Secretly, you are awfully pleased with yourself for getting a better cut of beef :D.\n\nThe End.",

You leave the Sheng Siong a happy dude. \n\nThe End.",

You go home, bok choy-less but pleased with all dat money. \n\nTwo days later, you see the Yakuza-looking dude on TV. He shows off the bok choy you sold him, except that it was no ordinary vegetable. It was a rare species that grew once every 1000 years, and people were offering him upwards of $10m to take it off his hands. Bewildered, you could do nothing but sit in silence and be sad.\n\nThe End.",

You decide to quickly buy the vegetable and bring it to your scientist friends to take a look...\n\nUnfortunately, they tell you, it is just a normal bok choy. You get sad and start looking at your bank account's balance, wondering how it would have looked like with an extra 100k in it.\n\nThe End."
