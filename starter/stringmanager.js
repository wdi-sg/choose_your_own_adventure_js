The bed linen is warm to the touch, and you know you've been lying in bed for a while.\n\nYou notice the humongous windows to your north, half concealed by regal blue curtains. To your east seems to be a mahagony study desk. There seems to be a door to the northeast.",

The room is enormous, supported by pillars that are adorned with marble, handcarved cherubs... but many of them look damaged, and some of them even look like they have been deliberately destroyed. \n\nIncomplete suits of armor line the edges of the room. Some of them are dented and rusted. \n\nSunlight barely peers through the stained glass windows, which are covered in a layer of what looks like grime... and blood... You sense something is very wrong here.\n",
        greathall: "You notice that in the northern section of the great hall - on the throne - sits an old man with a crown on his head. You can hear him coughing viciously from time to time. He sounds very ill.\n"
